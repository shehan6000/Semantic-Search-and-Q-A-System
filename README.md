# Semantic-Search-and-Q-A-System

## Overview

In this project, we aim to develop a robust Semantic Search and Question Answering (Q&A) system leveraging machine learning techniques. The system utilizes natural language processing (NLP) models to understand, search, and retrieve relevant information from a dataset of Stack Overflow questions and answers.
